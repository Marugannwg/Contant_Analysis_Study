Thus, would they risk truly, willingly letting Talulah control a whole city\u2014even a whole country's state of affairs?  Or perhaps, even this is one of the weights on Talulah's scales, used to swindle the Ursus military out of their power... having them hibernate somewhere, waiting until the situation is just about to move on from her control.

News about this quickly traveled to the conglomerate's leader\u2014Count Boris.   At the time, the Count made a bold decision. He tried to build an industrial city with all the necessary facilities and equipment with the expectation that his conglomerate could shake its reliance on the military-controlled mining industry and the arms trade.

I joined the group\u2014in order to keep them from blowing the entire city up.    I am something like an expert on the topic, so, one way or the other, I ended up becoming the scientists' mentors.   Now, Chernobog wasn't just your average emerging city. It used to be old and run down.   Before the scientists realized what the device's true purpose was, I allowed them to siphon a certain amount of its energy to provide Chernobog a resource other than Originium. Not much, but certainly not negligible.    Count Boris was beyond elated. He paid all that money, and he certainly got his money back.   He was someone who really knew how to do business.   Chernobog quickly developed, and droves after droves of people were drawn to the city, seeking opportunity.   Many smaller cities joined the Boris Group as well, either out of respect for Boris himself or because they were awed by how generous the man was with his money.   With Chernobog propelled to the fore, the scientists' research also reached an important breakthrough.   I... probably should've stopped them.", "response": "\"protagonist\": Yes\n\"antagonist\": No\n\"extrovert\": No\n\"introvert\": No\n\"ally/companion\": Yes\n\"trickster\": No\n\"shadow\": No\n\"shapeshifter\": No\n\"warrior\": No\n\"sage/wise one\": Yes"}
{"character": "Kal'tsit", "chunk": "  Let me continue.   Brilliant as they were, a few of my students uncovered the device's secrets on their own. First, they realized that the energy they were siphoning was generated only as a side effect of the device's operations. A kind of hibernation mode...   Its original purpose was for the device to keep functioning normally.   There was also one other thing that they realized. The energy that they had been siphoning for Chernobog was but a small fraction of the energy the device could actually provide. Just a tiny, tiny fraction.    At first, they were ecstatic.   This had to potential to greatly reduce Chernobog's reliance on the Originium mining industry.   If they could put together something similar to the device, then Ursus would never have to worry about energy again, and the mining and refining process of Originium would also become much simpler.   Then, fear began to sink in. If all that energy was used to forge weapons or begin a conquest, Ursus would undoubtedly be engulfed in a sea of flames yet again.    Now, fortunately, the scientists were all good, upstanding people. They wanted to prevent disaster.    And unfortunately... that didn't change a thing.   When the Fourth Army got involved, the scientists had already realized just how serious the whole situation was.   And by the time my students were ready to have the device sealed, the secret police had already figured out all of their weaknesses.   Ilia was a leader amongst the scientists. He was both righteous and stubborn, qualities that went hand in hand.   The secret police knew that kidnapping his family would only unleash the hatred in him, so they picked someone else.   Sergei, my oldest student.   He was Skullshatterer and Misha's father, a very indecisive chap.   The secret police hardly even threatened him, and that was enough to destroy what little determination he had.   The fear of losing his family and his respect for his colleague and their work tormented him, and in the end he chose what must have felt like a compromise to him.   He turned over the experiments' objectives and data to Count Boris.   The reality is he shouldn't have trusted anyone. A drowning man will clutch at a straw, yet that straw could also be the very thing that ends up killing him.    The Count didn't protect the scientists. He protected just Sergei and allowed the military to carry out an attack, which then turned into a massacre.    The Count didn't have the power to protect the scientists. He could barely even hold his head up in the presence of the military's top brass.   Even though the military and the nobility had lost much of their influence after the Great Rebellion, that didn't change the fact Count Boris's family was new money. They bought their noble status from another family.   Sergei managed to save his children, and the price he had to pay was to watch the murder of all of his colleagues in the Core City's sarcophagus.   After all the bodies were removed and the blood cleaned up, a new lab was set up for Sergei, built on top of his crumbling mentality.   Needless to say, Sergei never again produced anything meaningful with his research, and with the loss of all of their distinguished, albeit overly honest, scientists, Ursus's research on the device ended up in quite the mire.   After that, everyone simply forgot about the place. No one cared. Nothing could be changed.   After the secret police and the garrison packed their bags, the Count and Sergei had the placed sealed... The whole process was uneventful, too.   The equipment was kept running, and the energy just kept flowing from the sarcophagus to Chernobog's core city. Perhaps powering the entire city, even.   For Sergei's service and sacrifice, the Count nominated him to the position of the City Council secretary.   Oh, and this happened after Sergei's son, Alex, was found to be Infected and exiled.    The Count finally had the power to stand up against the military, and factories big and small began to spring up around his core city.   The Fourth Army no longer had him under their thumb. All they could do was watch Chernobog leave its circle of influence.   In the years since Chernobog began its operations, Count Boris also managed to make an enemy of Grand Duke Baikal, one of the advisors of the Third Army and the biggest beneficiary of the Farscope Refinery, thanks to their disputes over the prices of the raw materials used in manufacturing.   The Grand Duke ordered several clandestine attacks on the city, but none of the attempts were able to shake the city. It had already become one of Ursus's most important cities.   The Count then arranged matters so that the military was not allowed to garrison in Chernobog, so the armies could only do as the emperor told them, and stationed in the city's surroundings to defend it. To keep a watchful eye on the place, so to speak.   What's more, Chernobog is not bound by the military and the old nobility's rules. One after another, copycat cities began to emerge all around Ursus. The desire for minerals and products drove the masses to seek out better ways.    Instead of being mere slaves that reek of filth and blood, they wanted to become slaves of a higher purpose.", "response": "Based on the provided dialogue, the character archetype for 'Kal'tsit' can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- Protagonist: No\n- Antagonist: No\n- Extrovert: No\n- Introvert: Yes\n- Ally/Companion: Yes\n- Trickster: No\n- Shadow: No\n- Shapeshifter: No\n- Warrior: No\n- Sage/Wise One: Yes\n\nKal'tsit exhibits traits of an introvert, as she is described as a character who is knowledgeable, observant, and reflective.

Dr. {@nickname}, there are people who inflict violence and send others to the gallows merely because they don't know the other person.   A person can kill another without remorse solely because they don't know a thing about them.   If we knew everything about those other people, would we improve in any way?   Or would we disregard their actions and judge them as stringently as we can merely because they have more of an identity now? Would we determine guilt and innocence solely based on their identity?   Because they are rich or poor? Normal or Infected? From Ursus or from Lungmen? Or from the city or the countryside?      Have you ever wondered why all the Infected that Rhodes Island takes in are from the cities, are from well-off families, and had a decent education?   You have to admit. There are Infected out there who live in the wilderness, away from civilization; others live in far off places with no way to communicate with the cities; then there are those who live on the streets and in the back alleys, just trying to survive from one day to the next.   None of them have ever even heard of Rhodes Island.   To say nothing of those other Infected-oriented pharmaceutical and medical companies.   This is the reality we are in.   They didn't want to resort to violence. They just never had the chance to learn what else they could do.   In the past, many people worshipped the power of violence because of the violence others had inflicted on them. Violence worked on them, so they used it on those around them, and that worked on those other people as well.   Therefore, violence became their tool. They don't understand life without violence, and their lives will always be ruled by pain and hatred.    Violence isn't a plough. The road traveled by violence will always remain a barren land.    The Infected who was held in the sarcophagus and got warped into that monstrosity\u2014   Do you think he's evil?   Were we all born evil?   Was it power and violence that created the evil in humans, or was it the evil humans who created these tools to do harm to their fellow men?   We don't have the right to judge others. No one has that right.    To recognize goodness and then do something good, to recognize evil and then to refute evil, and to combat evil with evil and then to win. All that makes us no different from our enemies, and we'd have to take our own lives by that logic.   But, Dr. {@nickname}, if you know me, then you'd know that there are always certain things that need to be done by someone.   But these are definitely not reasonable and fair behaviors, and certainly not something you can just carry out and claim to have the moral high ground.

Dr. {@nickname}. Three years ago, with a heavily injured you in tow, I came back to this long-forgotten place, and placed you inside this device.   This device can heal your pain, and only your pain.   That was as detailed as I could possibly explain it.   The white Infected Creature we encountered earlier looked bizarre, didn't it? That wasn't how he used to look.   From this, I can conclude that before he became an Infected Creature, the Infected entered the sarcophagus, and that was how the sarcophagus was activated.   ...Perhaps he saw the footage of Amiya taking you out of the sarcophagus.   That prompted him to mess with the sarcophagus, and, one way or another, he got inside.   It shouldn't have happened.   The sarcophagus was originally designed to heal its operator, but this Infected got inside, and that's how disaster struck.    You saw the end result yourself. The Infected Creature wasn't a product of nature. The sarcophagus wasn't designed to handle it. Its transformation was entirely a man-made process. The sarcophagus transformed it.

We stopped the core city, we got involved in the attack on Lungmen, and we know the entire conspiracy. That's enough to have them plotting to destroy us.   What would the Third Army do if Lungmen decided to strike at us?   They'd grab the popcorn.

Brashly attempting a space flight carries risk nobody could anticipate, though Saria didn't yet know the full extent. Not until the events in Trimounts, until Operators Ptilopsis and Silence were drawn into a seemingly unrelated incident\u2014 Yet no matter when, even when I surmised she was trying to re-challenge the skies\u2014I admit, I had no anticipation the situation would be what it is today. With how things have unfolded, with our personally witnessing the S.H.A.F.T.'s scope and scale, H.A.M.H.R.R.'s ascent, and... the research Loken Williams is now attempting. It was soon after, with hindsight, that I realized what Rhine Lab Control Kristen Wright is attempting is impossible to achieve. Some outside force assisted her, massively influenced her. Borrowing military funds and connections, continuing the research her parents left behind, the young genius has used Rhine Lab as a shell to deceive everyone, and point herself directly at her one greatest, most obstinate hope in life.

A brand new perspective, a flourishing science, the moment when the sky becomes possibility itself, and even the very upheaval of how war is fought. People could reach other cities in a tenth of the time. Air vehicles, once a valuable rarity, could become typical transport means overnight. But Kristen has chosen to leave all this to the coming generations. She's never considered this from the angle of benefit\u2014be it how she personally stands to gain, or how everyone does. Even the potential crises invited have gone ignored by her. Is there one more possibility, that Kristen, who lost her parents at a young age and grew up amid skepticism and derision, is out just to prove this one truth to people, and nothing more? This may well be what Saria thinks. As fellow students with Kristen in days past, as the very first supporter of her dreams... Regardless of how bleak Kristen Wright's past was, how pure her vision, even how little was of her own personal doing... She has never had any right to avoid these responsibilities. Think of what Operators Ifrit and Silence have been through. Rhine Lab Control is self-centered, of that there is no doubt. Saria wishes for her to assume these responsibilities. Saria wants to urge her to turn her eyes, fixed towards the sky, down to each and every individual, living, breathing person in Rhine Lab... Perhaps Saria was meant to be the first to see Kristen's vision through for her, but then within Rhine Lab, at the crossroads of morality and ethics, everything spiraled out of control. Regardless of anything, Saria and I have both been a step behind.

She is portrayed as a central figure who is looking out for the team's best interests.\n\n- Antagonist: No\nThere is no indication in the dialogue that suggests Amiya exhibits traits of an antagonist. She is more focused on the team's safety and the success of the operation rather than being in opposition to others.\n\n- Extrovert: No\nAmiya appears to be more introverted in the dialogue, expressing her concerns and observations in a thoughtful and reflective manner. She is shown to be observant and focused on the task at hand rather than seeking external stimulation.\n\n- Introvert: Yes\nAmiya displays traits of an introvert through her internal thoughts, reflections on the team's situation, and her trust in her fellow operators. She seems to process information internally and is attentive to the dynamics within the group.\n\n- Ally/Companion: Yes\nAmiya embodies the ally/companion archetype by showing support for her team members, acknowledging their contributions, and expressing trust in their abilities. She is depicted as a reliable and supportive figure within the group.\n\n- Trickster: No\nThere is no indication in the dialogue that suggests Amiya exhibits traits of a trickster. She is portrayed as sincere, trustworthy, and focused on the mission at hand, rather than engaging in deceitful or manipulative behavior.\n\n- Shadow: No\nAmiya does not embody the shadow archetype in this dialogue. She is depicted as a supportive and trustworthy figure within the team, rather than representing hidden or repressed aspects of the characters.\n\n- Shapeshifter: No\nThere are no indications in the dialogue that suggest Amiya exhibits traits of a shapeshifter. She appears consistent in her role as a supportive leader and ally to the team, without displaying traits of adaptability or deception.\n\n- Warrior: No\nWhile Amiya is part of a team involved in an operation, the dialogue does not specifically highlight her as a warrior archetype. Her focus seems to be more on strategy, teamwork, and reconnaissance rather than direct combat or aggressive behavior.\n\n- Sage/Wise One: Yes\nAmiya demonstrates traits of a sage/wise one through her insightful observations, trust in her team, and strategic thinking. She appears to have a deep understanding of the situation and the importance of teamwork and preparation for the upcoming phases of the operation."}

{"character": "Amiya", "chunk": "  Attention, our outstanding operators, I have some important information to report to everyone in Rhodes Island. This is Amiya.   As of last night, Rhodes Island has officially left Lungmen.   In light of recent developments, the trade agreement between us and Lungmen has been cancelled. We no longer have any reason or standing to remain inside the city.   Fortunately, we've already purchased a lot of supplies from Lungmen, which will sustain our operations for a while.   Unfortunately... Some of our operators will shortly be going deep into Chernobog's core city.   An extremely tough battle awaits us there.   ...Many may think that war is a distant concern to us.   War, they may say, is a conflict between two countries, and has nothing to do with a pharmaceutical company.   But war... I think war has never left us.\u00a0   We have always been in a war. The long war of injustice against the Infected, the war that drives people to hate one another.   To develop an effective treatment for Oripathy and give the Infected a chance to use it, our medics have poured countless hours into their research.   Likewise, it has always been our goal to provide the most advanced medical treatment to those here who suffer from Oripathy, inhibiting and slowing the progression of Oripathy.   But that is far from enough. Before we can achieve these goals, we must face the ever-growing conflicts between the Infected and uninfected.   The enemies of the Infected will not see them treated. And each crime they commit against the Infected aggravates the tensions between the groups.   All while others exploit and enslave the Infected for their own profit.   There are those who oppose us and even attack us, solely because we seek a cure for Oripathy... We have suffered this in the past.   Imagine... Imagine if we develop a medicine to treat this disease, but never have a chance to administer it to the Infected. What then?   Our enemy is not only 'Oripathy.' There is no safety for us standing back from this war anymore.   Two weeks ago, Reunion and Rhodes Island engaged in a violent confrontation. Many of our operators sacrificed themselves in Chernobog.   ...a story we have seen unfold far too many times.   But if every sacrifice demands vengeance from us, then we will be locked into an endless cycle of revenge. Countless lives... will be taken.   Taken by our enemies, and taken by our own hands.   Our struggle with Reunion cannot rest upon hatred. If we are able to negotiate with them, we will demand from them an explanation, and hold them accountable for their actions.   But Reunion is still gripped by their madness, even today. They have taken control of Chernobog's core city, and are driving it into Lungmen.   Even stranger, Ursus has not surrendered its territorial control of the core city.   They retain a territorial claim on Chernobog, even with it under Reunion's control, even when Ursus never...                                                         Even when Ursus never took action as this entire incident unfolded. The Empire of Ursus ignored the atrocities committed in Chernobog, and made no effort to stop them whatsoever.   ...They abandoned their own citizens.   This has led me to conclude that Ursus has conspired to bring about these events. A collision with the core city will spark an international war. A war between Ursus and Yan\u2014\u2014   By then, it will be too late.   No matter who stands behind Reunion, no matter how hard they've pushed, no matter who the real mastermind behind all this is: there will be only one truth laid grimly at our feet.   \u2014\u2014'The Infected caused this war.'   No matter the outcome of the war, the Infected will always be the scapegoat.   They will face even more brutal oppression, more miserable lives, and... an eternal, fiery hatred.   If that comes to pass, all Rhodes Island has done will come to nothing. There won't be a single country in the world that will allow us to treat the Infected, or allow them a normal life.   Indeed... this is an unavoidable part of our protracted war on Oripathy.   Rhodes Island has always been fighting this war. And it's a difficult war to win.   But despite that, we will never give up.   We will fight the fanatics with reason, and enmity with clever strategy. We will press on, because no one wants to see a bitter end to our efforts.   So we will stop Reunion. We will stop the Chernobog core city from colliding with Lungmen.   I hope those of you staying here on the landship will look after Rhodes Island.

Don't sound all high-and-mighty about things you can't do!   Chi Xiao - Rouse Qi!   \u2014\u2014Release!   You can block it with just your wrist?   Out of my way!   Planning to call reinforcements? Chi Xiao\u2014!   Gah..!   ......   Do it then, Master Wei. Chi Xiao answers to me.   The day you gave me Chi Xiao, did you think I would slay you?   I won't use it to spill your blood, Wei Yenwu.   You think you're protecting me, right?   My mother died to depression. Talulah was taken away. I contracted Oripathy in the course of my work.   You think everything you've done was for the sake of protecting me, don't you? Is that because of your guilty conscience, or because of your confidence in your own strategies?", "response": "(\"protagonist\": No); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": Yes); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": Yes); (\"sage/wise one\": No)"}
{"character": "Ch'en", "chunk": "Liar!   Wei Yenwu, there are those who this sword seeks to kill... and those who it seeks to protect.   If she truly wishes to destroy Lungmen...!   I never thought I would beat you and your Black Cloaks here.   ...But there is more than one way out of here, Wei Yenwu.   This wouldn't be the first time I've used the window route. Or the second.   *Sigh.*   Uncle...   No... Wei Yenwu. Starting today, we are strangers.   Hoshiguma...? What are you doing here? How about your injuries?   Good. Now, I\u2014   Hold on. Were you waiting for me here?   ...   What are you trying to say?   How did you know I'd be here...?   But that's not what you're here for.   This is my only way out of Lungmen.   I stayed dark the whole way. If the whole L.G.D. knew me half as well as you do...   ...Excuse me?   What do you mean by that?   Hoshiguma... are you going to stop me?   Why you, of all people, Hoshiguma?!   You're a Lungmenite, Hoshiguma!   This is our last chance. If Wei Yenwu has it his way, more people are going to die!   ...   They call you 'Madame Oni.' They trust you to take care of the Lungmen they love so much. Let me go, Hoshiguma.   You\u2014   ...   Ah Faat died, all those people died for Lungmen... You're going to pretend you never saw any of that?   It's my duty to protect Lungmen. No matter who stands in my way, it's my duty. That hasn't changed.   I did.   You mean, he\u2014   You give him too much credit.   If he wants to die, he's welcome to it. But what will that get us? What's the point? Will it prevent a war? Will it get Lungmen out of this mess?

Wei Yenwu didn't want anyone to know. We couldn't have an Infected in the L.G.D. So I couldn't be Infected.   Hoshiguma, there is no place for the Infected here. Or anywhere else in the world.   I've had enough of Wei Yenwu controlling us. I'm not going to be his tool anymore.   ...What?   I don't care.   You didn't see how ruthlessly he treated the Infected. I did.   And Nine? She's already gone. She quit the L.G.D. because she was Infected too.   You know, Nine and I might've contracted Oripathy on the same mission.   She went undercover for me in Reunion... And then, because of Reunion, she abandoned Lungmen.   Because she saw the truth of this city.   Hoshiguma, why do you think... I'm going to the core city?   Heh...   Do you know who's leading Reunion?   Talulah.   Missy didn't tell you?   Talulah is my sister.   ...Why...? Is my sister, my family... not important enough?!   ...   That's not for you to decide, Hoshiguma.   \u2014No matter what stands in my way, whether it's a Catastrophe, a shield, or an Oni, I'm not giving in!   Force you? Why are you talking like Wei Yenwu...? I don't like it.   When Wei did what he did... no.   When he betrayed his brother, failed my mother, and put this city to sleep under his cloud of wickedness, that's when I decided to do this.   What do you mean...?   ...You don't get it.

How can you say I don't understand you?!   \u2014Thank you, Hoshiguma.   But I'm still going.   If we have to fight, you should know I'm not scared of you.   Hmph.   Stop. Talking. Like. That.   *Pant* *pant*...   We... have never... been able to walk away... from our past.   Hoshiguma, you've always been a part of this city. But... not me. I've always been running.   I don't think I'll ever be able to stand this place.   ...   Sorry, Hoshiguma.   After I'm gone, please go to the slums for me. The people there are panicked and confused. Someone from the L.G.D. has to protect them.   If some Infected kids give you a toy bear...   Keep it. An Ursus girl named Misha taught them how to make those bears. She died, because we failed her.   I'm sorry. I owe you one.   Hoshiguma...   \u2014\u2014   ...Take care of yourself.   ...What's going on? Dark clouds? It's snowing?   But, it's also covered the sun for me. This'll make my next step a lot easier.   Ugh... I can't afford to take any more hits.   Tch... Are you scared of shedding a little blood, Ch'en Hui-chieh? What happened to your determination?   ......   There seems to be infighting among Reunion's ranks. This is the best time for me to move.   Are my hands trembling because I'm finally going to see you again?   ...I must do what is right.   It doesn't matter what you are now, whether or not you're the same Talulah I knew.   Talulah... we have a date.   Tal!   Definitely.   Ursus wouldn't give someone like me an entry permit.   Don't ever call me that again, please.

Well, aren't you forgetful? Or are you just playing dumb on purpose?  My apologies, Chief Wei.  Sir, I am referring to the incident that took place roughly ten years ago when the city was infiltrated by foreign forces. Several Lungmen citizens were kidnapped, and they are yet to be found.  I will continue to push the city to investigate and locate the kidnapped citizens after my admission to the department.  Sir, I am perfectly aware of what I am talking about.  ......   Ngh... guh.

We poured our blood, sweat, and tears into this city, and its people are harsh, but it will come to accept everyone in the end.   It will. It's been improving.   Nine, even if we're Infected, we are still part of Lungmen!   Lungmen is a city for all people. That's how it should be. If it isn't right now, then we will make it so.    Have we not seen enough?
