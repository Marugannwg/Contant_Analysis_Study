{"character": "FrostNova", "chunk": "  Ugh....   I was born in a mine in the northwest tundra.   The mine was small and remote, not part of any city, and there are with no settlements around. There was nothing to see but snow all year round.   This mine was hell, built only to spread death and slavery. There are countless such mines in the snowy plains.   My birth parents were miners in that hellish pit.   My grandmother stayed with me through my early years of learning to speak, but she never told me what crimes my parents committed to be sentenced to mine labor.   Later, when I was a little older, I asked around in the mines and learned that both of my parents had opposed the Emperor's wartime plans.   Their arrest was also an accident. The bottom two lines of the arrest warrant were blank, so the sergeant in charge of the search haphazardly copied the name on the door plate.   Without trial, my parents lost their names and moved from their warm little town to the cold Northlands to serve a centuries-long sentence.   Of course, no one would even live to see that, let alone ever leave alive.   My grandmother was sentenced to the mines together as a 'harborer' of criminals, and moved with them.   In fact, all the miners there had very similar experiences.   Naturally, both of my parents contracted Oripathy down there. All the miners did.   Now, even if you escaped this mine, no one would believe a word you said. You're just an Infected person, the most horrible, vicious and extreme of the Oripathy patients.   However, the overseer of the mine, a certain Ursus military garrison, believed that the natural death rate of the Infected was still too slow.   They drew straws to decide the fates of the Oripathy sufferers, killing them for fun and sport.   Maybe it was the miners that drove them crazy, rather than the snow. And maybe the Infected didn't count as human in their eyes.   When I was five, my parents drew the black lot.   When I was ten, my grandmother drew the black lot.   When I was eleven, I drew the black lot myself, but it didn't matter, they didn't care about the lottery anymore. They just want to abandon the whole mine.   By that time, all the adult Infected in the mines had died out, and the Emperor's new policies had left the mines starved of people.   Under orders, the Ursus overseers prepared to go ahead and execute the last of the Infected.... A few sick children.   Afterwards they would collapse the mines to serve as mass graves for the infected, to cover up their sins.   I learned later, in my travels, that they do this all the time.   I was sad. I was in pain.   I had broken a lot of ore. I lived with other kids in the mines, we loved each other, and we were all going to die for nothing.   Strong feelings hatched in my chest, the deaths of both my parents and my grandmother played vividly in my mind.   When the execution started, my Arts erupted from within me, killing the four soldiers carrying out the execution..   Of course, I didn't have the power to turn things around.   The children were mere cattle to the overseers, who, as soldiers, carried sharp blades and wore solid armor, and we were like bugs who just managed to sting them.   The cries of my siblings reached my ears just as they knocked me to the ground and the final wave of slaughter was about to begin...   A guerrilla band arrived.   That was Buldrokkas'tee's team.
