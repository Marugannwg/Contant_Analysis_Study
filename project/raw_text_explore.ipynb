       "[\"...... Your concern is unnecessary. Lin Qingyan, what do you mean by this? You know I'm not referring to that. You were waiting here from sun-up, so you could hold me from visiting those three. You have to have some reason for me. Lin Qingyan! ...... ...Auntie. Why do you always bring this out to stifle me? It's not as if you're an honest relative. You're just relying on the friendship between the Lins and my dad, and being a generation older. Just why did the Tianshi Bureaus have you make this trip? How nice for the common people. If that's the case, will you really just ignore... will you really just carry on like this? ...... No one sent me. I volunteered myself. What? Don't you believe me? This is my first time hearing that the impartial, incorruptible, honest, forthright Lin Qingyan of the Central Judicial Office has learned to speculate on the bureaucracy's murky secrets. Don't rumors say you're sick of giving those sorts of shameless busybodies the time of day? That if anyone tries to wag on at you, you shock their brain numb? This, right now, is far from your style. ...Tch. I did not. You misheard, Auntie. But... ...... Understood. I will accompany you back.   I am Zuo Le, a... court Messenger. We will leave it at that.   Ms. Kroos, Mr. Nothing. Please accept my apologies.   I understand the transgression was Uncle Taihe's, but allow me to remind you:   If you are not too involved with those sisters, I suggest you put an end to that relationship while you still can.   To tell the truth... You've likely already crossed the line.   Heh.   Ms. Kroos, you're a woman of extraordinary courage and skill.   Now we have other business to attend to. Please excuse us.   If things were really so simple, then I would find myself worried about Mr. Liang's eye for talent.   Mr. Zheng, do we know anything about the visitor from Lungmen yet?   Anything special about him?   That's my father's greatest worry taken care of.   True though, considering the sort of methods that Lord Wei of Lungmen usually employs... If he were involved, we wouldn't be sitting here enjoying tea right now.   I'm surprised that you'd show such a keen interest in someone like him.   I see. It's true that he's a swordsman... As for his swordsmanship, though, all I know is rumors.   In any case, can we assume it was Mr. Liang himself who chose to involve the Lungmenite?   Hm... He is the only remaining variable, and also Mr. Liang's only trump card.   Mr. Liang doesn't have much of a choice himself. If only... *Sigh*... No, it wouldn't have mattered.   Isn't her presence in Shangshu the reason everything has gotten so out of hand?   The legends of Shangshu have always been so magnificent.   The Operator from the medical company... Kroos, was it?   If it wasn't for your help, she would likely have caught up to me. You have my thanks, Mr. Zheng.\",\n",
       " \"At the end of the day, Rhodes Island is an unknown. What do you think, Innkeeper?   They are nonetheless standing very close to the table.   And what's your assessment?   Hoh? Did you arrive at that conclusion as Zheng the Innkeeper or Zheng Qingyue, the Asker to the Frost?   You haven't once looked away from that fake cup.   ......   From what I heard, the Sui Regulator once secretly commissioned the renowned Xingyu Escort Association to transport an item, only for it to be lost in an accident en route.   I'm afraid I'm not very good with comforting words, Mr. Zheng.   How did you escape then, Mr Zheng?   Oh... The incident you were just talking about, of course. My father always tells me that I am still young and inexperienced, and should learn from my elders.   If you would continue to share your story with me, I'll gladly listen.   Regarding Miss Du...   No, she's your family. I am in no position to meddle in your household affairs.   How many inns and restaurants have you opened here in your town?   Not at all. My father always tells me what youngsters like me lack isn't persistence or conviction. It's an understanding of everything that surrounds us.   ......   Thank you for your advice.   ......   ......   Hello, sir. How may I help you?   Did all of you lose your wallets together?   ......   It has been a while since my blade was last unsheathed. How could it possibly rust?   Of course... Rhodes Island has gotten too involved.   Here's a Yanese idiom you might like, Miss Kroos. 'Justice casts a wide net.'   A medical company that strives to rescue all Infected and sees them as equals, regardless of their race, status, and wealth—   —Even the purest of mountain springs must be no match for Rhodes Island in purity.   Oh, please don't get the wrong idea... I didn't mean that as a threat.   After all, if Rhodes Island was a dishonest organization, you two would be in jail right now.   In other words, I would like you two to see our current situation as a form of trust.   However, Infected should not be wandering about in such a bustling part of town out in the open. Safety remains a concern, after all.   Would you follow me? Let's take this somewhere else.   Very well. I see you two are of formidable talent as well. I'll wait for you at the top of the tower to the north in a quarter hour.   You truly are a swift one, Miss Kroos. The innkeeper wasn't kidding.   Where is the man with the fan?   How peculiar... I thought you would send him, while you hide in the shadows.   As the saying goes, one should sacrifice a pawn to save one's queen. Not only are you the 'queen,' you're a crossbowman and an escape artist.   Even so, you came personally.   And yet you still have a mind for danger, especially when you have to go it alone, don't you?\",\n",
       " \"Haha... so temperamental. Forget I said anything, then.   I'll get to the point. We've looked into Rhodes Island a little. With so little time, we didn't dig up a lot of information.   I don't claim to fully know you, but at least know you can be trusted.   You must put the right people to the right job. Oripathy is a misfortune that all Infected face. What does that have to do with their responsibilities or skills?   I would like Rhodes Island to do us a favor.   No, in fact, if you don't help us, then I'm afraid you'd be making an enemy of us.   No wonder he thinks so highly of you.   You know of 'Sui?'   Oh... Looks like you're not lying, though you know only half the story.   Considering you see Nian and Dusk as friends... and that she told you about this much, they must see Rhodes Island as a lifeline of sorts.   In years past, so long as they stayed in line and broke no rules, the Sui Regulator would turn a blind eye to whatever they did.   But nowadays, things are different.   Not only are the times changing, you are on friendly terms with Nian, and you even brought Dusk off her mountain. That put you on the Sui Regulator's wrong side.   I know you meant no ill will, but what comes next?   How is Great Yan meant to know that they are not planning anything when they are all in one place?   I'm not trying to exaggerate.   Nian and Dusk disappeared not long after they reached Shangshu, and it just so happens that a goblet associated with them made its way here around the same time. Furthermore, the man of the hour is on Rhodes Island's side.   This is a tremendous coincidence. Wouldn't you say so, Miss Kroos?   And I'm not one to believe in coincidences.   You make it sound like we don't want to share.   They may take different forms, but all nations approach the same problem in their own way. Everyone faces this issue.   Though, because of certain... historical reasons, Great Yan's Sui Regulator happens to be at the forefront of 'Feranmutology.' Always has been. Always will be.   Kjerag still worships them as gods and Sami attempts to coexist with them, but the Sui Regulator's research has advanced to unparalleled heights.   Did Nian tell you about those legends? The old emperor, the wild hunt, and what they uncovered?   In ancient times, the people thought of certain creatures as 'gods,' and with civilization's advancement, they gradually began to go into hiding.   The 'Sui' is one such creature.   Whether they actually meet the definition of a living being is up for debate, and I don't suppose we need to go there.   All you need to know is that when at last they come to bring destruction to the world, Yan has the power to annihilate them. That's all.\",\n",
       " \"This is not exactly confidential Sui Regulator information, but it's not exactly common knowledge either.   I'm telling you all this not because I want a scholarly discussion.   Nian, Dusk, and the one who's in hiding somewhere in Shangshu. All of them are under the Sui Regulator's surveillance.   Normally, these things would not happen at such a pace. But then one day, the clouds all dissipated from that mountain. By the time the Sui Regulator Candleholders arrived, Dusk was nowhere to be found.   It took only a few days for the Candleholders to brief the court on this matter too.   Rhodes Island is getting itself involved without knowing the whole picture. The ignorant are blameless. On the contrary, it's unimaginable that you would work with those two without knowing anything.   And now, we would like Rhodes Island to follow the Sui Regulator's arrangement and persuade the Lungmenite to surrender the goblet himself.   Correct.   You call the magistrate by name, but gave the Lungmenite a courtesy title. That shows you are a good person.   Please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to beat around the bush. All I'm saying is that you aren't hiding your trust in the Lungmenite anymore. Is it because of his partnership with Rhodes Island?   There aren't many people we can truly call friends. It seems Nian and Dusk are your friends too.   I'm afraid that's more than what Rhodes Island needs to know.   There's nothing to hide. It's just a more elegant way to go about this to save our mandarins some face.   Now that I've told Rhodes Island so much, can we set aside our differences and negotiate?   We'd like Mr. Lee's too.   The elimination of the Sui.   You're back, Uncle?   How were things?   If she was so ready to display etiquette, that shows there's still room for mediation.   This is regardless of how she acts, or what intentions she harbors. Master Tai's instructions lie here, and they can't be false.   Very well.   If we really do want everyone to trust that our methods can forever rid Yan of the sword hanging over her head, then we naturally must obey those magic words—   —Frank and forthright.   Close call.   Are you hurt, sir?   No need to be so cold, Uncle Taihe...   Wherever the goblet goes, Waregeists spring up. Ironically, it's proving the Sui Regulator's conjectures.   Does this mean...   As you instruct, Uncle Taihe.   *Sigh*...   Take a look at these Waregeists. How many incidents like this have we had?   While we have wrongdoers wreaking havoc with Originium Arts on occasion, things really don't come any better than this.   But Sui in the end is Sui, and a beast in the end is a beast. If your people carry intent to harm the realm, then Heaven knows how great the disaster will be.   The Sui Regulator has no desire to see such things come to pass.   Which is why we need to settle this millennium-long mess swiftly and cleanly.   ...No more than detritus.   Mr. Nothing.\",\n",
       " \"Please, convey this to Ms. Kroos for me. I want her to reconsider what I've said.   We can be on good terms regardless. Even if she should ultimately have her own considerations, my side still has a matter it wishes to entrust to Rhodes Island irrespective of position.   Haha... well, at that moment...   I was a little tensed up. I didn't get everything out.   Well, then... It seems we can't delay any longer. Mr. Nothing, we bid you farewell.   Master Shang. Do you have any idea what that thing on your belt is?   Yes and no, but we hope you'll hand it to us.   We've heard some rumors.   If your first reaction is to think of Sir Zheng, then presumably you know where we came from?   But it seems like those things and the item at your waist are unrelated.   I imagine you'll find absolutely no purpose in this cup.   But to we of the Sui Regulator, the cup has tremendous use.   Bait.   Those who bring ruin to the nation and its people.   That's need-to-know.   However, we ask you to believe us. Entrust the goblet to us, and you'll have done a justice great as the heavens.   I fear that's not for you to decide, Master Shang.   Get the goods before anything! Don't let him keep you!   Uncle Taihe...!   You couldn't catch him?   He's using the goblet as a threat, forcing Innkeeper Zheng to meet with him.   Is there no leeway?   The Field of Forgotten Water, was it?   We need to seize the opportunity.   Hm.   Very much a happenstance.   The goblet.   There's no point in hiding it now. Yes.   And someone unaccounted for has it.   If I told you, would you assist us in taking it back, Ms. Kroos?   ......   Are you asking us, Ms. Kroos, or... interrogating us?   This goblet was made by the hands of a great offender.   You treat them as your 'operators.'   ......   A fearsome beast dwells in this goblet. It's only a portion of his consciousness, of course.   I'm within my rights. If any ensuing liability falls on the Sui Regulator, you needn't have mercy, Uncle Taihe. Apply the legal proceedings.   Contemporary feranmutologists are in consensus that, aside from some form of corporealized body, walking in land beyond land, this ancient colossus also has means to dwell within certain objects.   The ancient literary saying, 'the beast walks with the generous earth,' actually gives some pointer as to these creatures' characteristics.   Weapons are fairly common. Whether it's ancient Sarkaz swords or modern, mass-produced staves, we have precedent.   But as for the concrete principle, we're still not sure.   Wherever it goes, Waregeists spring up. We can't say we're certain yet, but we have grounds to suspect it.   The cup is alive, yet it hasn't come to life. The objects around it are all dead, yet live because of it.   It's been adrift for a long time. It's by a random chance we were able to determine its location.\",\n",
       " \"No.   I said, just now, its maker was guilty. But its present master is someone else entirely.   A poet.  Mr. Zheng!  Thank you, sir.  Taihe.  Miss Du, what's your business here?  Why not?  ......  Miss Du, you should know we handle affairs impartially.  Please, step aside.  Then you'll have to excuse me!  —The Yin-ch'ing Fan of the Liens. As fine a kung fu as expected.  I'm fine.  So Rhodes Island doesn't intend on assisting the Sui Regulator?  A beast's heart is hardly fathomed. What can her character be worth?  Uncle Taihe, You help the innkeeper out.  I'll search for the cup. It can't wait any longer.  ...Oh.  Rain?  Ah! It's that Lungmenite!  Are the Waregeists surrounding him...? Hold on, who's that next to him?  Nian...!  I am Zuo Le, Candleholder of the Sui Regulator of Great Yan. By Master Tai's instruction, I am confidentially investigating Dusk and the black goblet's whereabouts.  You're swift.  ......  It's none of your concern.  But if you're showing of your own accord, then all the better...  Where is she?  Stop playing the fool!  What?  There's nothing in the Field of Forgotten Water. It's no different than an ordinary mountain.  —! Don't touch that cup—!  —  Firstly, I need you to give an explanation for Dusk's departure.  Ms. Kroos persists in regarding you as a Rhodes Islander. Thus, all three of you here have some relation to the company.  In accordance with your answers and this incident's resolution... I will consider penning a letter to the imperial court, with grave regard to this matter.  No. Any time the twelve of you meet, exchange messages or converse is a major strain on the Sui Regulator's nerves. How can you be ignorant of that?  You've been idle for too long. The human realm has gone through changes.  Where's Dusk? And where's Ling?  And what intent do you three have, assembling in Shangshu? And what secrets... does this goblet hide?  You know the significance of us necessitating it be in the Sui Regulator's hands—  You're well-aware. Then it's exceedingly hard to consider any of you here unaware or innocent.  The Feranmut is not only able to separate parts of itself into proxies with independent personalities, but can store its consciousness within certain mediums in order to roam...  But can your proxies really do the same thing over again? Just as if you were an Ursus matryoshka.  Wouldn't he go mad?  Meeting with him would be the greatest taboo.  What about Dusk? What did you seek Dusk for? And why did you come here after doing so?  According to the records, you're always full of ideas.  Are you aware of what you're saying?  Are you going to kill yourself?  Is Its mind not your minds?  All nonsense.  What ideas do you have?  I'm only obligated to hear out your idea. Whether I trust it, or not, is the Sui Regulator's decision.\",\n",
       " \"A year ago, Yan realized something.  Victoria's incidents. Ursus's endless unrest. One of Leithanien's Empresses losing her voice.  All under heaven was in turmoil, and Yan had to prepare.  The court met day after day, and passed the 'Twenty-Eight Policies.' Nothing unaccounted for, and not solely seeking the safety of Yan, but offering survival to the known world.  But outside of the Twenty-Eight Policies published, there were still hidden two more that needed Yan's urgent decision.  The Grand Tutor has met with that great offender.  The Grand Tutor mends the realm's affairs, inspecting for leaks and patching holes.  Angry?  Would you show anger at a rascally child who blames the sky for raining?  The Grand Tutor gave the Sui Regulator a hidden aim. Something that must be accomplished, whether or not we openly chafe with the Ministry of Rites for it.  Three things.  First, retrieve the goblet. We don't know why, but he spilled all to the Grand Tutor as to the cup's origins and rough whereabouts.  Second, aside from preserving the two hidden policies, find an even more reliable proposal, to keep this situation suppressed to a minimum.  Third...  No matter who they are, should more than three proxies gather on one side, pass on personal handwritten instructions from the Grand Tutor.  Correct.  So, I ask, Where is Dusk?  This is my duty.  They'll simply do again what was done a millennium ago.  Moreover, now, we are strong, and your powers feeble.  The Sui Regulator's principles are simple. Finish it once and for all, and forever rid the future of plague.  You're only scheming to allow yourself escape.  Even if I believed you, why should I believe you can accomplish this preposterousness?  If you can't, then how much unnecessary danger will your existence engender? Doesn't the Sui Regulator have an even more 'dependable' plan to solve this problem?  You cannot convince me.  You must be...  What do you mean?  ......  You know how this goblet came about.  Hand it over.  You understand reason, Mr. Lee. You should know the severity of this.  If Ning Ciqiu doesn't give a reasonable explanation, Liang Xun will pay for his unilateral action.  ......  The last time the Sui Regulator neared that shrine, a body was discovered inside it.  It was Grandmaster Xiang Ru. Heart failure, died while vomiting blood. The weiqi board was empty, save for a single black stone at the center.  The Sui Regulator is investigating it.  But this goblet, without a doubt, is a crucial key to uncovering his plot. And the two of you, Miss Nian, Miss Dusk...  The Sui Regulator wishes for you to come with us.  In that case... how about Miss Ling?  The Sui Regulator records that he disagrees with all the other bestials, willing only to recite poetry and make merry with Ling and Shu.  If she still won't show herself, then the Sui Regulator's only option is to—  When did...  What did you just...\",\n",
       " \"This and that are independent. Even once you see his instructions, you must still behave and come with the Sui Regulator.  Indeed.  Take it.  My duty is solely to give the letter.  In that case... who are you?  I only know general strategy.  I've met you before, Assistant Minister Ning.  What does this match signify?  It's very hard not to.  The state of things is evident to all at this point. You don't need to carry on mystifying them.  This isn't a topic you can discuss here.  You have no freedom of movement. You shouldn't have seen the Grand Tutor before.  Uncle Taihe.  I met the offender.  But if we truly take him at his word, then the three face their own self-shackles at this moment.  I just don't understand why the Grand Tutor would trust that offender.  If they fail, we'll be confronting their reflection here in Shangshu. Even if... it's only a small fraction.  ...Yes.  That's what my father hopes.  —!  The sky!  The shadows are taking form... Is this... Sui's reflection?  What is it... looking at?  What! It disappeared?  The Sui Regulator demands Nian and Dusk give an explanation.  Additionally, the three of you cannot act in concert. You must leave Shangshu under the Sui Regulator's supervision.  If Rhodes Island intends to attract even more scrutiny...  I thought the Central Judicial Office was unwilling to interfere in the Sui Regulator's affairs.  No wonder Miss Ning always held her fire... You persuaded Tianshi Bai beforehand.  But at what moment can the Tianshis take charge of this matter?  What?  ......  Miss Ning. Good to meet you.  We came uninvited and troubled you greatly. We should be first to apologize.  Your insight is as a beacon, Miss Ning.  But Mr. Liang's actions, breaking past settled positions, were all the more admirable.  As one should.  Here... here!  The former would require three days' effort. The latter would be mutual loss, with the feranmut dead, and three-tenths of the army gone.  —!  Uncle Taihe? So you long since...  Understood.  Shangshu's mountain ways are rugged. I fear it may be dangerous if you are alone...  No. I simply mind your advanced years. Be careful on lone outings, please...  So this bounty hunter really was yours, Assistant Minister Ning.  It was the Sui Regulator who hastened in its conduct; we won't question her deeply. Er... as long as she entered Yan's borders through legitimate means, of course...  You'd seen through both the Sui Regulator and Mr. Liang's schemes.  He may simply have been apprehensive about betraying you, Miss Ning.  Regardless, the Sui Regulator overstepped their bounds in this. We will later address the matter ourselves with the Ministry of Rites.  Farewell, Miss Ning.  ......  I can only hope this pair in love... aren't shaken by big things to come.  As a Candleholder, I've none of my own ties of the sort.  *cough*, *cough*—I trust that girl was only repaying the favor! How can you muddle this with affairs between the sexes?\",\n",
       " \"It was a life saved. If the intent was impure, that would only further serve doubts of advantage being taken.  You presume wrong, Uncle Taihe. Father is a busy man. I should not bother him at work. I don't. There's nothing for me to do at home anyway. I thought I might as well take a look around town. The Grand Tutor must have sent me to Yumen expecting something to happen. I should keep my eyes open. It's been years since the last time you were here, hasn't it, Uncle Taihe? It must bring back memories. The arena remains as popular as ever. You still rank fifth on the Board of Fame. Did something catch your attention? Ahem... The Grand Tutor says that a Candleholder's duty is to carry the fire that drives out the shadows of the Feranmut, and to travel amongst to people to learn their troubles. A sense of duty comes first, shrewdness second. Kung fu comes third or fourth at best. ...... So... How <i>do</i> I compare, then? Who goes there? Stop right there. Do you know where you are, and exactly what that sword you're holding is? ...... Let us set aside the question for the time being who it is you are working for and how you made your way in here. Hand over the sword. I'll take you to the Grandmaster. Impudence! The Grandmaster has defended Yumen's peace for a hundred years. How dare you speak ill of him?! I've arrested no small number of criminals, but you are the first one I've met to be so arrogant. I see I have no choice but to get you to comply forcefully, then. You're injured. Where can you run? Watch out, Grandmaster! It all happened too suddenly. I wasn't prepared, and I wasn't able to take the assassin in, as a result. It was a young female assassin who infiltrated us and took the sword. She was hurt when she made her escape. Aside from that... I'm afraid I don't have anything. Sir! Yes, sir! Are you the doctor, sir? I apologize for the interruption. We are investigating a case and pursuing a suspect. Here is my token. We would appreciate your cooperation in answering a few questions. Has this clinic treated or seen anyone who suffered serious a stab wound? I would like to take a quick look. It'll only take a minute. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the clinic's work. I would rather not have to force my way in. But this concerns the safety of all of Yumen. Your cooperation would be appreciated. Then I apologize. (This man is no ordinary brute!) ...... Do you understand the consequences of obstructing justice? Enough! This is not a game. There's someone else in there?! What the...? You said no heavily wounded patients were taken in lately. How do you explain the gauze and blood? Stop right there! He just disappeared? Sorry... What the—?! Who's there?!\",\n",
       " \"(Did he intentionally draw me here?) (A commotion here would...) (Where are you?) ......! Mr. Lee? I noticed. Did you...? No choice, I suppose... Let's get out of here. We don't want civilians getting hurt. Do you have an idea? Wait–– (Heavy panting) Q-Qiubai... it's been a while... ...... Why have you come? A friend I met on a previous mission... and an old acquaintance of Liang's. My life would have been in danger if not for your help. But are you really here by chance? No jokes, please. This is important. What else do you know about what happened in Yumen last night? ...... I stabbed the assassin in the scuffle last night, so I started my search in the clinics. I searched every single clinic in the city and didn't find anything unusual, until the last one. A man called himself a helper and would not let me in. I forced my way in and found gauze and blood. The man ran off with an agitated look on his face. I wasn't sure what to make of it. Obstruction of justice is a crime, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what the man was talking about. It didn't feel premeditated. Let me think... Feline, male. Looks to be in his forties... exceptionally skilled in kung fu. ...... What happened?! Tell me his condition first! Uncle Taihe shouldn't have been involved in this, he was helping me under the table... Where is Father? ...... Where are the ones who brought Uncle Taihe here? Tell me the truth. The city is under high alert right now. What were you doing out so late at night? So you live in the area, but heard nothing strange? Where did you find the wounded? The Sword Forge... No. Your testimony is unclear, so as a witness, you can't leave just yet. Millenion. I'm moving out. Gather your team. Search the Sword Forge. Father ordered me to hunt down the assassin and locate the sword in three days to restore peace in Yumen. Even with his strength, Monitor Censor Taihe has been gravely injured. This surely has some link to the Feranmut followers. Going to the scene of the crime to find the truth and arrest the culprit, is that not sticking to my post?! Go. ...... Oh? You're Xingyu Inn innkeeper Zheng's... When did you get to Yumen? And why? I'm investigating a case. Sounds like there <i>is</i> something suspicious about this place... ...... Please do not obstruct the investigation, assuming you have nothing to do with it. ...... You— Show yourself! –– Some Sword Forge! Just a hideout for gangs. ...... This is the Grandmaster's sword. Now that I have the sword, I won't pursue this particular matter any further, if you're not working with the Shanhaizhong. The matter of your trespassing into the barracks can wait. Qiubai. Yes. I can listen to your reproaches later, after we've taken care of these!\",\n",
       " \"It's getting hotter. It's only March, and it's night. How could the temperature be rising? Could it be the Sword Forge's Originium furnace... This sword... You were the one who attacked Uncle Taihe! Murder of a Messenger, attempted theft of Catastrophe data, attempted assassination of a court official. What do you think Yumen is, Shanhaizhong?! You know why Yumen is returning... Father tasked me to complete three tasks in three days: recover the Grandmaster's sword, catch the assassin, and track down the Shanhaizhong who have infiltrated the city. It turns out all the answers were right here in the Sword Forge. How dare you! Stop right there! ...... Out of my way! This is a Yumen military case. Anyone who interferes will be arrested. Impudence! Did you see the Shanhaizhong on your way here? Good. Round them up and take them into custody. They appeared right as the criminals retreated and obstructed our pursuit. They must be investigated thoroughly. All the rest have something to do with the case. The Sword Forge is linked to the Shanhaizhong. Given your ties to Meng Tieyi, I would have asked you to come with us regardless. As for you... This is no time for jokes. —! Take these people back to the barracks for questioning. I'll go after the Grandmaster's sword. Stop right there. If you're not in league with those criminals, why did you steal the sword? What is your connection to the man at the clinic? You don't understand what kind of trouble you've gotten yourself in. You've never lived in a nomadic city, and you know nothing about Yumen. Someone told you where the sword was and got you to steal it. But you don't understand what kind of trouble it would bring. Tell me. Things may still be salvageable. Even if the price is your life? Whatever the truth is, I can't sit aside and let you put yourself in danger. I'm trying to help you. I'm under orders to investigate. You're the one who stole the sword. You may have your reasons, but that's no excuse for distorting the truth. They tried to cover the Shanhaizhong's escape. All involved must be investigated until they are cleared of suspicion. We face the double threat of Catastrophe and criminals. I must abide by my duty to Yumen. This is my duty... ...... There's been a misunderstanding, sir. I ask that you return the sword to its rightful master. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say. ...... Ridiculous! How can something so important be determined so callously? I'm not fighting— ...... It just occurred to me that even if I let you go, you still need a way out. I grew up here. I was a mischievous boy who tried to sneak out of the city through the sand sluices, and was duly punished by my father for doing so. But only someone as stubborn as you would dare take this way.\",\n",
       " \"Tell me, did you come to Yumen just for this sword? And you wish to present the sword as an offering? And after that, will you return it? That eccentric from the clinic promised me earlier that if you broke your word, he would bring you back himself. But having said all that, retrieving the sword was, and still is, my duty. So while I have no qualms about taking you at your word, just this once, I <i>will</i> get that sword back, even if I have to jump into the sand sluice myself. 'Yi nuo qian jin.' You may not know the idiom, literally 'a promise worth a thousand gold.' Break your word, and I will drag you back here, personally. Three quarters past the Hour of Yu... the turbines should have slowed down by now, there's no time to waste. Get going! Found you... good thing your footprints weren't completely wiped away. You weren't lying about planning to come back to Yumen. To get the sword back. And to make sure you're safe. No time to talk about that. We need to get back to the city! You were lucky to survive the jump down the sand sluice. Your injuries will take a long time to heal, though. Here, hold on to me. –– I must be seeing things. There couldn't be anyone else out here at a time like this. Let's go. Grandmaster. Thank you for coming here to the Sword Forge. The sword has been found, but she insists on returning it to you personally. About Mr. Meng... ...... Still, my ill-considered actions have alienated the jianghu heroes of Yumen. I will speak to my father and accept any discipline, once this crisis has passed. And I will indemnify any losses suffered by the Sword Forge, as well as the costs of any repairs. ...... I did what had to be done. My conscience is clear. I'm sure you understand that the Shanhaizhong are even more dangerous to Yan than the Feranmuts. The Feranmuts may be powerful, but we won the hunt a thousand years ago. Yan is even stronger now. There is nothing to fear. What is truly frightening is the shadow that had been cast on people's hearts since time primordial. Heaven and earth, the moon and stars, wind and rain, the changing of the seasons... it is unfathomable, beyond our reckoning. The Feranmuts were the same to the people of the time. Ignorance breeds fear, which becomes twisted into religion. To those madmen, we are the ones we are the outsiders. We are the traitors.\",\n",
       " \"The Shanhaizhong's activities never waned, even after the Feranmuts faded from the public eye. In the past centuries, they have absorbed bandits, pirates, robbers, and other sorts of villains. They use the Feranmuts as a shadow to conceal their activities. Sui Regulator records indicate that the Shanhaizhong have done unmeasurable harm in the name of the Feranmuts. The scale of their deeds is so widespread that complete elimination is impossible, and the vileness of their acts horrifying. They have started to reach out to the proxies of your kin. They were thankfully foiled by the timely intervention of the Sui Regulator. However, the Sui's true form stirs from slumber, Yumen returns to its motherland, and the Shanhaizhong have infiltrated the city. It is a complex web, too complex to be a coincidence. All under Heaven is the offender's Go board. The Shanhaizhong may simply be a piece in his game. ...... Or perhaps, the Shanhaizhong have already made contact with the Sui. Yes. Yes. ...Yes. ...... ...... ...For all the people. ...... Thank you for your guidance, Grandmaster.\"]"

Have some faith in your big sister.   Hurry! They're coming!   They are deploying some units wearing other uniforms... They might be Lungmen's L. G. D.!   *Cough* *cough* ... *hack*.   Go!   And the fighting... how goes?   You have nothing to hide.   And those uninfected Lungmenites we saw...?   ......   *Cough* *cough*...   ........   I'm awake.   You didn't kill me while I was unconscious. Is that confidence or something else?   In any case, you didn't.   ........   I'll take that as a sign that you've shown mercy. Now if I don't kill you, I'd call that returning the favor.   Why the consternation on your face?   Is it because...? You heard everything I saw in my dream?   It seems I really did reveal something very unpleasant in my stupor.   Memories are something you can't lose even if you want to.   Have you explored our surroundings?   Couldn't find a way out, could you?   Looks like we won't be able to leave this place for a while.   ........   My father, as I call him, is named Buldrokkas'tee and was once an officer in the Ursus military.   But my real father died a long time ago.   As a child I vaguely remember a man taking a crossbow bolt to protect a woman; and the woman took me in her arms and stopped the second volley of bolts with her spine.   I couldn't even comprehend what was happening at the time, and this memory just happened to never fade.   As for what really happened, it was my grandmother who told me all about it later.   When I pressed my grandmother for the meaning of that vision, and she had no more excuses, she told me.   'They were your real parents.... and they died protecting you.'   The funny thing is, I don't know them at all. I don't have any memories of them in my mind other than that vision.   My own parents were just forgotten. It's hard for me to even say I have any feelings for them.   ........   Half and half. The other half was the blood of the Ursus Infected.\""

Keep at it with this baby and we might even be able to get it over the wall and sneak a peek at what's going on inside... Don't you worry, I wouldn't put everybody at risk like that. We've just gotta hurry up and develop that stealth coating... Got somebody within detection range... It's charging its automatic attack module. Wait, wait, that's the rescue team! Disable the alert! Amiya, Doctor! Indra and Dagda are back! Woah... Are we finally going to start the operation? Ugh, if only I could splash a coat of stealth paint on our operators too... ...Vulnerable to their artillery blowing us to bits! I've done some rough calculations.

Siege, Londinium's cannons here are serious business! That means they're rolling out the red carpet for us, right? Urgh... Ahhh, I can't take it anymore––!

It's like we burrowed ourselves into some kind of pipeline... The walkway's broader, but it's still sark as hell... Waaahhh...

We can use the supply line in Highbury and get the hell out of Londinium! We've got too many wounded men and non-combatants. Taking an underground route will help us avoid most of the fighting! Wha?

It's <i>you</i> who should be evacuating with the rest of them! Tsk, crafty dipshit. So, we've got three teams. Horn, Misery, and Logos will lead the primary operation to resist the Sarkaz assault. Doctor, you go with Amiya and Siege's gang to hold the other Sarkaz pursuers. Shining and I will follow the rest of the Self-Salvation Corps and evacuate this place without making any noise.

Ace and the gang thought there was no way we were going to win, but we actually managed to pull it out.   Right? It felt off to me before I even finished looking through the thing, but the Doctor told me I didn't need to worry about any of that.   It's like... the Doctor knew about everything in advance, even the probability that I'd have the thing cracked.   Who knows how Dr. {@nickname} managed to do that?   Also, speaking of which... This is just my own feeling, but when I met the Doctor here again, it kinda felt like meeting a totally different person.   C'mon! We're not looking into that possibility.\",\n",
       "  '(\"Ally/companion\": Yes); (\"Sage/Wise One\": No); (\"Shapeshifter\": No)'),\n",
       " (\"  I can tell, the Doctor who came back to Rhodes Island is the same old Doctor, though... also kind of like a completely different person on the inside, too.   How can I say this...   Just like that last operation. The Doctor's calculations were so accurate that our jaws all dropped. We won a fight we weren't going to win.   I almost gave our friend a nickname, 'Super Demonic Processor.'   But then, the very next time, the Doctor surprised us with a whole other strategy.   It's like that was a whole other person all of a sudden, who could figure out the other side's thinking, perfectly, without using any formulas or whatever.   Whatever kinds of records Dr. {@nickname} leaves behind or doesn't, I'm not gonna call it strange.   That's a real difficult question.   If you ask me, I think... only the 'Doctor' can influence the Doctor.   The Doctor keeps quiet sometimes, but is also really talkative at other times. Have you noticed that?   I kind of think that, maybe the Doctor is normally so quiet because it's like laying the groundwork for some kind of pivotal moment to come.   The Doctor makes decisions that look wild and crazy to us, beyond our expectations, and those decisions lead Rhodes Island down an entirely different path.   PRTS, remember what I said was the first thing that Theresa told me, when we first met?   She said she was looking for someone who could break the shackles of tradition. I think that's the standard she used to pick people, so that's what most of us here have in common.   Of course, the Doctor too. Everyone follows the Doctor, they go right along without hesitation.   Looks like that mystery creator of yours liked it too.\",\n",
       "  '(\"Protagonist\": Yes); (\"Shapeshifter\": Yes); (\"Sage/wise one\": Yes); (\"Ally/companion\": Yes)'),\n",
       " (\"  Whatever the case may be, that's how things are. The Doctor treats everyone well, though I guess the old one treated everyone pretty well too.   It's just it's not easy to figure out just what this nice person is going to do and when or where the effects will actually play out. If the bad guys can't make sense of it, do we have a hope of figuring out the Doctor just because we're on the same side?   To tell the truth, I kinda have doubts.   No, not at all. Compared to Kal'tsit, I get along with Dr. {@nickname} way better!   The point is, this Doctor is nothing like the old one. If we look at the new one the same way we did the old one, then I'd say we're underestimating our new Doctor.   Yeah... that's probably because I really admire the Doctor, from the bottom of my heart.   It was hard on everyone when Theresa left us. We lost way too many people in those two years... You know that better than anyone else.   We were driven into a corner, basically. No matter which way we decided to go, we were walking a rope that could snap at any time.   In the end, it was Amiya who decided we had to do something to get us out of that mess.\",\n",
       "  '(\"Sage/wise one\": Yes); (\"Ally/companion\": Yes); (\"Shapeshifter\": No)'),\n",
       " (\"  That's right. Amiya believed the Doctor would bring lots of change, something that Rhodes Island desperately needed at the time.   It was a gamble, really.   We had to do something, we had to change. It was better than watching the few friends we had left bleed all over the place for no good reason.   Amiya was the only one to give orders back then, and she helped a lot of folks make up their minds on the topic, when they'd been wishy-washy.   Time proved Amiya right.   We needed the Doctor. The Doctor brought change to Rhodes Island.   Hm...   Y'know, PRTS, I've always thought of you as a pretty strange entity.   The way you think is basically on the level of humans, but... you're still lacking something... something human.   Persistence.   That's the kinda thing that drives people to achieve great things, and sometimes turns them into monsters.   Eh...? Wait, what am I doing? I thought I was gonna tell you a story.   Dammit, I was going to talk about my heroic adventures as the 'Destroyer of the Kazdel Information World,' but somehow I got so off topic...   You aren't trying to make fun of me now because I had you admit you were terrible at telling stories, right?   Dammit! Don't you keep this conversation in the logs! I don't want Kal'tsit to find out what a long conversation I had with you the next time she goes looking stuff up.   Hold on... You won't play this for her, right?   Well, that's good to hear...   Hmm?   Huh?   Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Don't do it!   Seriously, don't you dare! I'd start coughing up blood from embarrassment even before Kal'tsit got to me. Now that'd make me a real disgrace to the vampires!\",\n",

Restricting permissions... Right, this will do!   Yep, your checkup is just about done. Well, I'll get going—   —Whoa! Dr. {@nickname}!   What are you doing here... How long have you been there?!   Feels kinda suspicious.   Are you here to check the battle records from the other day? Eh, don't just stand there. Come on in! I just finished PRTS's checkup.   I'd love to have a chat with you, but I got facility checks around the ship. Don't have much time.   Well, gotta go!
